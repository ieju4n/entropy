At this place, it will find the codes developed to achieve the results of the paper “Complexity analysis of Brazilian agriculture and energy market: sugar vs. ethanol.”

The developed approach in this paper base on SampEn and Cross-SampEn multiscale methods, it demonstrated to be a valuable tool for analyzing financial series in recession periods since as reveal their complexity over time. In this case, the ethanol stock market presented lower regularity versus the sugar stock market, possibly caused by prices fluctuations, closures of some mills, higher demand than production capacity and by other factors. Note that we selected the mentioned methods due to the time series have few observations (weekly data). Additionally, we applied the overlapping sliding window protocol to improve the analyses.
