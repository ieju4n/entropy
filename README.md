The used approach for this work is base on SampEn and Cross-SampEn multiscale methods, and it demonstrated to be a valuable tool for analyzing financial series under the effects of macroeconomic events, such as recession periods, since as reveal their complexity over time. We invite you to read our paper and the obtained results there. Note that we selected the mentioned methods due to the time series have few observations (weekly data). Additionally, we applied the overlapping sliding window protocol to improve the analyses.
