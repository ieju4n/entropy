DESCRIPTION.

Here, there are the codes developed to achieve the results of the paper “Complexity analysis of Brazilian agriculture and energy market: sugar vs. ethanol” published in the journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications.

The used approach for this work is base on SampEn and Cross-SampEn multiscale methods, and it demonstrated to be a valuable tool for analyzing financial series under the effects of macroeconomic events, such as recession periods, since as reveal their complexity over time. We invite you to read our paper and the obtained results there. Note that we selected the mentioned methods due to the time series have few observations (weekly data). Additionally, we applied the overlapping sliding window protocol to improve the analyses.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

(i) Before starting, read the system requirements file
(ii) Start with the files labeled as main, e.g., main_multiscale_SampEn.R for better understanding
(iii) Change the path variable in the scripts, according to the folder where are the files in your computer
(iv) Do not hesitate to contact us if you need assistance or if you found any bug
(v) Please cite our work whether found it useful
